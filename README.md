# geralt-bot-v2

Version 2 of "geralt-bot", a personal project which I started when learning to code discord bots. Version 2 is similar to version 1, but made using TypeScript instead of JavaScript.

## Features:
### Message listener

When added to a server, it listens in conversations for the following words, after which it will respond with the corresponding gif.

| word  | gif                         |

### Slash commands

For everything command related, the bot features slash commands. These commands are the following.

| Command       | Description                                                                       |
